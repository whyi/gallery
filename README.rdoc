in bundling mysql2 I got some errors, and the following link contains a piece of information to fix it:
* http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3608287/error-installing-mysql2-failed-to-build-gem-native-extension

== Database
* rake db to create database
* rake db:migrate VERSION=20140831004115 to create the table

== README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the

Things you may want to cover:

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

Please feel free to use a different markup language if you do not plan to run
<tt>rake doc:app</tt>.
